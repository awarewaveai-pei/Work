## Findings

- No drift. Generation rate and volume are within budget.

## Why this check exists

ClickHouse was fixed four times in four months (2026-04-20 / 04-29 / 07-05 / 08-15).
The first three raised the memory ceiling or deleted accumulated rows; none of them
stopped the generators, so it returned with a different symptom each time (OOM, then
OOM death spiral, then a permanently pegged CPU). This check watches the ratio rather
than any single table, so the next flood is visible even if it comes from somewhere new.
